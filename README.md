Griddler
========

### Receive emails in your Rails app

Griddler is a Rails engine (full plugin) that provides an endpoint for the
[SendGrid parse api](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API%20Reference/Webhooks/parse.html) or
[Cloudmailin parse api](http://cloudmailin.com) that hands off a built email object to
a class implemented by you.

Tutorials
---------

* SendGrid has done a
  [great tutorial](http://blog.sendgrid.com/receiving-email-in-your-rails-app-with-griddler/)
  on integrating Griddler with your application.
* And of course, view our own blog post on the subject over at
  [Giant Robots](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/42286882447/handle-incoming-email-with-griddler).

Installation
------------

Add griddler to your application's Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'griddler'
```

Griddler comes with a default endpoint that will be displayed at the bottom
of the output of `rake routes`. If there is a previously defined route that
matches `/email_processor` -- or you would like to rename the matched path -- you
may add the route to the desired position in routes.rb with the following:

```ruby
post '/email_processor' => 'griddler/emails#create'
```

Defaults
--------

By default Griddler will look for a class to be created in your application
called EmailProcessor with a class method implemented, named process, taking
in one argument (presumably `email`). For example, in `./lib/email_processor.rb`:

```ruby
class EmailProcessor
  def self.process(email)
    # all of your application-specific code here - creating models,
    # processing reports, etc
  end
end
```

The contents of the `email` object passed into your process method is an object
that responds to:

* `.to`
* `.from`
* `.subject`
* `.body`
* `.raw_body`
* `.headers`
* `.raw_headers`

Each of those has some sensible defaults.

`.from`, `.raw_body`, `.raw_headers`, and `.subject` will contain the obvious values found in the email, the raw values from those fields.

`.body` will contain the full contents of the email body **unless** there is a
line in the email containing the string `-- Reply ABOVE THIS LINE --`. In that
case `.body` will contain everything before that line.

`.to` will contain all of the text before the email's "@" character. We've found
that this is the most often used portion of the email address and consider it to
be the token we'll key off of for interaction with our application.

`.headers` will contain a hash of header names and values as parsed by
the Mail gem. Headers will only be parsed if the adapter supports a
headers option.

Configuration Options
---------------------

An initializer can be created to control some of the options in Griddler. Defaults
are shown below with sample overrides following. In `config/initializer/griddler.rb`:

```ruby
Griddler.configure do |config|
  config.processor_class = EmailProcessor # MyEmailProcessor
  config.to = :token # :raw, :email, :hash
  # :raw    => 'AppName <s13.6b2d13dc6a1d33db7644@mail.myapp.com>'
  # :email  => 's13.6b2d13dc6a1d33db7644@mail.myapp.com'
  # :token  => 's13.6b2d13dc6a1d33db7644'
  # :hash   => { raw: '', email: '', token: '', host: '' }
  config.reply_delimiter = '-- REPLY ABOVE THIS LINE --'
  config.email_service = :sendgrid
end
```

* `config.processor_class` is the class Griddler will use to handle your incoming emails.
* `config.reply_delimiter` is the string searched for that will split your body.
* `config.to` is the format of the returned value for the `:to` key in
the email object. `:hash` will return all options within a -- (surprise!) -- hash.
* `config.email_service` tells Griddler which email service you are using.

Email Services
--------------

By default Griddlers assumes you are using SendGrid as email service for posting
incoming emails. Griddler also supports the Cloudmailin service.

To use Griddler with Cloudmailin, tell it you want to do so in the initializer by
adding `config.email_service = :cloudmailin`.

Griddler expects to receive Cloudmailin's Multipart format.

Testing In Your App
-------------------

You may want to create a factory for when testing the integration of Griddler into
your application. If you're using factory_girl this can be accomplished with the
following sample factory.

```ruby
factory :email, class: OpenStruct do
  to 'email-token'
  from 'user@email.com'
  subject 'email subject'
  body 'Hello!'
  attachments {[]}

  trait :with_attachment do
    attachments {[
      ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile.new({
        filename: 'img.png',
        type: 'image/png',
        tempfile: File.new("#{File.expand_path File.dirname(__FILE__)}/fixtures/img.png")
      })
    ]}
  end
end
```

Bear in mind, if you plan on using the `:with_attachment` trait, that this
example assumes your factories are in `spec/factories.rb` and you have
an image file in `spec/fixtures/`.

To use it in your test(s) just build with `email = build(:email)`
or `email = build(:email, :with_attachment)`.
